    "- Interpret \"word problems\" and translate them into SQL queries\n",
    "- Decide and perform whichever type of JOIN is best for retrieving desired data\n",
    "- Use GROUP BY statements in SQL to apply aggregate functions like COUNT, MAX, MIN, and SUM\n",
    "- Use the HAVING clause to compare different aggregates\n",
    "- Write subqueries to decompose complex queries\n",
    "- Visualize data using matplotlib, seaborn, and pandas\n",
